# First steps

First clone the repo from the git repository, like below:
```
git clone https://github.com/Force67/equilibrium.git
cd equilibrium
git submodule update --init
```
Afterwards, execute pmake.cmd or pmake.sh depending on your operating system in order to generate the files required for building. You will find them in the `/out/` directory.
